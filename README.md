## Welcome to my e-commerce-backEnd!


## I would like to start with a list of things I learned on this project.

+ I learned how to format models for DB storage.
+ I learned how to create and utilize API routes.
+ I learned how to test and confirm API routes via Insomnia.

## Functions of my App
+ This app is backEnd functioning only.
+ When you open the terminal start by entering 'node seeds/index.js'
+ Then the database will be loaded with the seed files
+ Next you will type 'node --watch server.js' into the terminal
+ Then you will have a local server hosted at http://localhost:3001/
+ Now you will be able to use insomnia to preform GET, POST, PUT and DELETE on the following api routes
+ api/categories, api/products, api/tags
